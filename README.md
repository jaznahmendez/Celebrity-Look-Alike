# Celebrity-Look-Alike
## Implementation of AWS Services for Facial Recognition

### Description
The project consists of a web application hosted on an EC2 instance, where users can upload photographs. By using recognition services such as Amazon Rekognition, along with the support of Amazon Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB services, the application can return to the user the celebrity they resemble and the percentage of similarity between them and the celebrity.
